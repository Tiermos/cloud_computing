GitHub Pages Personal Website Project Report
I. Project Completion Status

I successfully created and deployed a personal website in accordance with the project requirements. The following are the specific steps to complete
GitHub account creation: A GitHub account has been registered
Repository Settings: A dedicated repository named [My Username].github.io has been created
Website creation: An index.html file was added to the repository as the home page
Website release: The website has been successfully deployed and is accessible via https://[my username].github.io
Version control: Code submission and management were carried out using Git

Ii. Website Content

The website design adheres to the principle of "simplicity and practicality", and only contains the most basic personal information:
My name
Gender
Age
Attend university
College to which

The website adopts a simple design style, without adding navigation bars, images or other complex elements, ensuring fast page loading and clear, easy-to-read information.
Iii. Technical Implementation
The technology used
HTML5: Building Web Page structures
CSS3: Beautify page styles
GitHub Pages: Hosting and deploying websites

2. Core features

Responsive design: Automatically adapt to the screens of different devices
The code is concise: just one HTML file with embedded CSS styles
Simple deployment: GitHub automatically builds and publishes

Iv. Learning Gains

Through this project, I have mastered:
The concept of static websites: Understood the differences between static websites and dynamic websites
GitHub Pages Usage: Have you learned how to host websites with GitHub Pages
Version control Basics: Practiced the basic operations of Git
Web publishing process: Understood the complete process from coding to going live

V. Project Verification

The website has passed the following verifications:
✓ It can be accessed normally through the specified URL
✓ The entire page content is displayed
✓ Render normally in different browsers
The code structure is clear and concise

Vi. Summary

This project enabled me to personally experience the complete process of creating and publishing websites using GitHub Pages. Although the website design is simple, it fully meets the project requirements and reflects the core advantages of a static website hosting platform: no need for server management, simple deployment, and stable access.

Most importantly, through practical operation, I have understood the actual application scenarios of PaaS (Platform as a Service), laying a foundation for learning more complex Web development in the future.
